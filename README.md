## How it works

### 1) For this website I decided to only use bootstrap. Striving to learn the tech.

### 2) Here is the fairly simplified code. Leveraging bootstrap and not using CSS to formate the page.

### 3) I then add a script tag the will allow me to retrieve the data needed.

### 4) Next, I declare all of my variable so that I can dynamically change them in the DOM.

### 5) Here is where i make the original api call to access the data from Weather app. With string interpolation I am able to dynamically change the city that the user wants.

### 6) This is the code I used for the button displaying the data. I recycle the code and reuse it for every button as well in the next function that makes a request off of the search history.
